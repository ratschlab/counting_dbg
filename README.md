# Lossless Indexing with Counting de Bruijn Graphs

This repository contains resources related to the manuscript describing Counting De Bruijn Graphs.

The algorithms and the Counting DBG data structure itself are implemented within the [MetaGraph](https://github.com/ratschlab/metagraph) framework (commit [1cf7a6e](https://github.com/ratschlab/metagraph/tree/1cf7a6e629c847f29148155c6f0770f71d901e2a)).

Note: all alignment experiments with MetaGraph were run on commit [b349a53](https://github.com/ratschlab/metagraph/tree/b349a5374bbd0524f304225fcf1d7eb492212c45).
